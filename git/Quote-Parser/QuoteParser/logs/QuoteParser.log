The company bought Italian tyre manufacturer Pirelli last year and German firm KrausMaffei, which makes machinery for manufacturing polymers, in December. The company is one of China’s biggest state-sponsored businesses, and has grown steadily since starting life in 1984 as an industrial cleaning firm called Bluestar, set up by Jianxin with a small government loan. After acquiring over 100 domestic companies through the 1980s and 1990s, it began buying overseas firms, earning Jianxin the nickname ‘merger king’ in the Chinese media.

2016-04-06 10:58:12 INFO  PatternsParser:224 - line to group capture is: The acquisition of an agrochemicals business is likely motivated by China’s desire to ensure food security, amid concerns that agricultural productivity is not keeping pace with population growth. Its purchase of Syngenta – a producer of genetically modified (GM) seeds – also hints that China is becoming more willing to embrace GM technology. The country has been reluctant to adopt GM because of public opposition, and while GMOs are used for animal feed, they are not yet grown as food crops.

If China allows GMO cultivation in the country, then the degree that the market is opened to other international players will affect industry leader Monsanto and other multi-nationals.’

But there are several hurdles to overcome before it can be given the go-ahead. For one, at least 67% of Syngenta shareholders will need to vote to accept ChemChina’s offer. The move is also facing scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which can take steps to block deals that are deemed a threat to US national security.

He adds that the US has been protective of seed technology in the past, as demonstrated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s efforts to prevent Chinese nationals leaving the US with seeds. As Syngenta owns many seed-based patents, this could be a potential sticking point. Regulators in Europe are also expected to take a close look at the takeover.

Its purchase of Syngenta – a producer of genetically modified (GM) seeds – also hints that China is becoming more willing to embrace GM technology. The country has been reluctant to adopt GM because of public opposition, and while GMOs are used for animal feed, they are not yet grown as food crops.

If China allows GMO cultivation in the country, then the degree that the market is opened to other international players will affect industry leader Monsanto and other multi-nationals.’

But there are several hurdles to overcome before it can be given the go-ahead. For one, at least 67% of Syngenta shareholders will need to vote to accept ChemChina’s offer. The move is also facing scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which can take steps to block deals that are deemed a threat to US national security.

Its purchase of Syngenta – a producer of genetically modified (GM) seeds – also hints that China is becoming more willing to embrace GM technology. The country has been reluctant to adopt GM because of public opposition, and while GMOs are used for animal feed, they are not yet grown as food crops.

The move is also facing scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which can take steps to block deals that are deemed a threat to US national security.

"When global growth starts to slow down, you get growth inorganically because it's hard to get growth organically. That's one of the big drivers.

Its purchase of Syngenta – a producer of genetically modified (GM) seeds – also hints that China is becoming more willing to embrace GM technology. The country has been reluctant to adopt GM because of public opposition, and while GMOs are used for animal feed, they are not yet grown as food crops.

If China allows GMO cultivation in the country, then the degree that the market is opened to other international players will affect industry leader Monsanto and other multi-nationals.’

But there are several hurdles to overcome before it can be given the go-ahead. For one, at least 67% of Syngenta shareholders will need to vote to accept ChemChina’s offer. The move is also facing scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which can take steps to block deals that are deemed a threat to US national security.

And Syngenta’s interim chief executive John Ramsay said: "We have a very attractive offer on the table and we are putting it to our shareholders." It’s probably fair to say the senior executives at the Swiss seeds and pesticides maker are onboard with this deal, with the all cash nature of the offer no doubt a help.

2016-04-06 15:35:19 INFO  PatternsParser:224 - line to group capture is: ChemChina’s offer to buy Syngenta for $43 billion prompts UniCredit to downgrade the Swiss company’s bonds to underweight from marketweight due to the unclear refinancing of the acquisition. It sees a high risk of Syngenta bearing a large part of the takeover price during the refinancing process. The influence of ChemChina on Syngenta’s strategy is also a concern, but the Chinese group will likely aim to keep its subsidiary in investment-grade territory. UniCredit anticipates Syngenta bond spreads widening Wednesday and to remain volatile in coming months, given than regulatory and political obstacles to the deal remain

Its purchase of Syngenta – a producer of genetically modified (GM) seeds – also hints that China is becoming more willing to embrace GM technology. The country has been reluctant to adopt GM because of public opposition, and while GMOs are used for animal feed, they are not yet grown as food crops.

But there are several hurdles to overcome before it can be given the go-ahead. For one, at least 67% of Syngenta shareholders will need to vote to accept ChemChina’s offer. The move is also facing scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which can take steps to block deals that are deemed a threat to US national security.

And now comes the tricky bit, the companies must now surmount potentially fraught regulatory hurdles in the U.S. and elsewhere.

And Syngenta’s interim chief executive John Ramsay said: "We have a very attractive offer on the table and we are putting it to our shareholders." It’s probably fair to say the senior executives at the Swiss seeds and pesticides maker are onboard with this deal, with the all cash nature of the offer no doubt a help.

2016-04-06 15:37:01 INFO  PatternsParser:224 - line to group capture is: ChemChina’s offer to buy Syngenta for $43 billion prompts UniCredit to downgrade the Swiss company’s bonds to underweight from marketweight due to the unclear refinancing of the acquisition. It sees a high risk of Syngenta bearing a large part of the takeover price during the refinancing process. The influence of ChemChina on Syngenta’s strategy is also a concern, but the Chinese group will likely aim to keep its subsidiary in investment-grade territory. UniCredit anticipates Syngenta bond spreads widening Wednesday and to remain volatile in coming months, given than regulatory and political obstacles to the deal remain
